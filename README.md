Wanting to play with MapKit, I followed a few tutorials to [show the current location](http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Working_with_Maps_on_iOS_7_with_MapKit_and_the_MKMapView_Class), [search local businesses](http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Working_with_MapKit_Local_Search_in_iOS_7), and [get directions to them](http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Using_MKDirections_to_get_iOS_7_Map_Directions_and_Routes). 

Then, I extended the app to find the address of the current location, made it look pretty, and squished a few bugs. All in about a week. 

The result can be seen in this [quick demo](https://vimeo.com/117020263). 

The blog post is on it's way.
