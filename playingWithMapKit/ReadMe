1. Follow a tutorial. http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Working_with_Maps_on_iOS_7_with_MapKit_and_the_MKMapView_Class

The objective of this tutorial is to develop an iOS application designed to display a map with a marker indicating the user’s current location. Buttons located in a navigation bar are provided to allow the user to zoom in on the current location and to toggle between map and satellite views. Through the implementation of the MKMapViewDelegate protocol the map will update as the user’s location changes so that the current location marker is always the center point of the displayed map region.

2. Follow a local search and annotations tutorial. http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Working_with_MapKit_Local_Search_in_iOS_7

3. Follow a mkdirections tutorial. http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Using_MKDirections_to_get_iOS_7_Map_Directions_and_Routes

4. Now, how do I look up locations on the map? Reverse Geocoding.

Story: Find the address of the current location

In order to know where I am
As a person using the app
I want to see the address of my current location.

Scenario 1: I want to see the address near my current location
Given that the map shows my location
When I tap on the blue dot
Then an annotation should show my current address

5. Making it look pretty

To do list
Remove the jumpy effect on loading- don't center location automatically
Move bar buttons from toolbar to buttons on the map- default maps uses a toolbar, just move them apart
Make the callout for the first search result come up- used a block and had to use __block storage
Make the zip code and city on the same line- done with resizing the window
Make the map center and zoom when the current location is tapped- called zoomIn
After clicking the textbox, resign the first responder when the map is clicked- touches begins resign first responder
Add Directions- done
Zoom to include the destination in the Routeviewcontroller- done
Intelligently choose walking vs driving directions-
Do it with walking and if it’s more than 15 minutes, use driving- done
Make the starting region of the route, the same as that of the previous view- done
