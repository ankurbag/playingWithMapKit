1. Follow a tutorial. http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Working_with_Maps_on_iOS_7_with_MapKit_and_the_MKMapView_Class

The objective of this tutorial is to develop an iOS application designed to display a map with a marker indicating the user’s current location. Buttons located in a navigation bar are provided to allow the user to zoom in on the current location and to toggle between map and satellite views. Through the implementation of the MKMapViewDelegate protocol the map will update as the user’s location changes so that the current location marker is always the center point of the displayed map region.

2. Follow a local search and annotations tutorial. http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Working_with_MapKit_Local_Search_in_iOS_7

3. Follow a mkdirections tutorial. http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Using_MKDirections_to_get_iOS_7_Map_Directions_and_Routes

4. Now, how do I look up locations on the map? Reverse Geocoding.

Story: Find the address of the current location

In order to know where I am
As a person using the app
I want to see the address of my current location.

Scenario 1: I want to see the address near my current location
Given that the map shows my location
When I tap on the blue dot
Then an annotation should show my current address
